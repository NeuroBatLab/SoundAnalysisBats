    "# BioSound Tutorial 1.  From wav files to h5 files.\n",
    "### This notebook illustrates how to generate BioSound objects from sounds stored as wav files.  BioSound contains many parameters and it is up to the user to calculate some or all.  This script calculates all the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the BioSound approach the sounds have been previously segmented into units (here as separate wav files) of interest. Here we are going to analyze different renditions of the distance calls of different zebra finches to examine the individual signature.  The sound units could also be different bird songs from different birds, or different speech vowel sounds or different musical instruments all playing the same note.  "

    "The plotting routine in BioSound (.plot()) generates a variable number of graphs depending on what has been calculated.  The first figure shows the oscillogram and spectrogram of the sound.  The red bold line on the oscillogram is the amplitude enveloppe.  The black bold line on the spectrogram is the estimated fundamental frequency. The purple bold line on the spectrogram is the estimated fundamental frequency of a second voice (when it exists). The red, white and blue bold lines on the specrogram are the estimated first, second and third formants (F1, F2, F3).  The second figure is a power spectrum. The black dotted lines show the quartiles.  The red, light blue and dark blue dotted lines are the time average values of F1,F2, F3. The third figure shows the values of other BioSound parameters.  The fourth figure shows the modulation power spectrum.\n",
